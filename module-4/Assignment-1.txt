Camera Movement and Controls

Objective: Implement camera controls for user interaction in Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will learn how to implement camera controls to allow users to navigate and explore a scene with multiple 3D objects. You will choose from various camera control options, customize the camera's initial position, rotation, and zoom level, and provide an interactive experience.

Requirements:

Setting Up the Scene:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the Three.js scene.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
Adding 3D Objects:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a scene, camera, and renderer.
Add at least three different types of 3D objects (e.g., cube, sphere, and plane) to your scene using the BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry, and PlaneGeometry classes.
Camera Controls:

Implement camera controls to enable user interaction. You can choose from the following options (or explore others):
Orbit Controls: Implement controls that allow users to orbit around a central point, zoom in and out, and pan across the scene.
First-Person Controls: Create controls that simulate a first-person perspective, allowing users to move forward, backward, and rotate the camera.
Customization:

Customize the initial position, rotation, and zoom level of the camera to provide an interesting starting point for users.
Testing:

Test your interactive scene with camera controls on different browsers and devices to ensure it functions correctly and provides a smooth user experience.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the camera controls you implemented, and any customization you applied.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment1_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Camera Controls: Did you successfully implement camera controls (e.g., orbit controls, first-person controls) for user interaction?

Customization: Did you customize the camera's initial position, rotation, and zoom level to create an interesting starting point for users?

Testing: Is the interactive scene with camera controls functional and providing a smooth user experience on different browsers and devices?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to provide an interactive and engaging experience in your scene?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
