Interactive Animations

Objective: Develop user-driven animations based on interactions in a Three.js scene.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will explore the creation of interactive animations within a 3D scene using Three.js. Your objective is to design a scene with objects that respond to user interactions and animate transformations (e.g., scaling, rotating) when users interact with them. Your goal is to create engaging and visually pleasing animations that enhance the user experience.

Requirements:

Setting Up the Scene:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the Three.js scene.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
3D Object Setup:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a scene, camera, and renderer.
Add at least three different 3D objects (e.g., cubes, spheres, custom models) to your scene using appropriate geometries and materials.
Interactive Animations:

Implement interactive animations for the 3D objects based on user interactions. These animations should occur when users perform specific actions (e.g., hovering, clicking, dragging) on the objects.
Explore various types of animations, such as scaling, rotating, fading, or any other transformations that enhance the visual appeal.
User-Driven Interactions:

Design user-driven interactions that trigger the animations. For example, animations may be triggered when a user hovers over an object, clicks on it, or drags it with the mouse.
Ensure that the animations are responsive and smoothly transition between states.
Visual Feedback:

Provide clear visual feedback to users during interactions. Ensure that users can easily understand when an object is interactive and when an animation is in progress.
Testing:

Test your interactive animations in the 3D scene on different browsers and devices to ensure they function correctly and provide an engaging user experience.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the interactive animations you implemented, and how users can interact with the scene.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment4_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Interactive Animations: Did you successfully implement interactive animations for the 3D objects in your scene based on user interactions?

User-Driven Interactions: Did you design user-driven interactions that trigger the animations, and are they responsive and engaging?

Visual Feedback: Did you provide clear visual feedback to users during interactions to enhance the user experience?

Testing: Are the interactive animations functional and providing an engaging user experience on different browsers and devices?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to make the interactive animations visually appealing and engaging?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
