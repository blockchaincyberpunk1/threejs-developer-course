Keyboard Controls and Navigation

Objective: Enable keyboard controls for navigation within a 3D scene using Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will learn how to create a 3D scene with keyboard-controlled navigation. You will set up a 3D environment with a controllable camera and implement keyboard controls to allow users to move the camera forward, backward, left, and right. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to adjust camera movement speed and responsiveness to provide a smooth navigation experience.

Requirements:

Setting Up the Scene:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the Three.js scene.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
3D Environment Setup:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a scene, camera, and renderer.
Add 3D objects to your scene to create a visually appealing environment. You can use simple geometries (e.g., cubes, spheres) and materials (e.g., Lambert, Phong) to create the scene.
Camera Setup:

Create a controllable camera within your scene. You can use the PerspectiveCamera or OrthographicCamera based on your preference and the desired navigation style.
Keyboard Controls:

Implement keyboard controls to allow users to navigate within the 3D scene. Use the keyboard input to move the camera forward, backward, left, and right.
Choose appropriate key bindings for the controls (e.g., WASD keys or arrow keys) and make sure they are responsive and easy to use.
Camera Movement Speed:

Provide an option for users to adjust the camera movement speed. You can use different keys or a slider to control the speed. Ensure that the movement speed can be modified to suit different user preferences.
Testing:

Test your 3D scene with keyboard controls on different browsers and devices to ensure it functions correctly and provides a smooth and responsive navigation experience.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the camera setup, keyboard controls, and how users can interact with the scene.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment2_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Camera Setup: Did you successfully create a controllable camera within your 3D scene?

Keyboard Controls: Did you implement keyboard controls to allow users to navigate the scene (e.g., forward, backward, left, right)?

Camera Movement Speed: Did you provide an option for users to adjust the camera movement speed, and is it responsive?

Testing: Is the 3D scene with keyboard controls functional and providing a smooth and responsive navigation experience on different browsers and devices?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to implement and present keyboard-controlled navigation within the scene?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
