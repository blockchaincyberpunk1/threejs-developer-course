Complex Interactive Scene

Objective: Build a complex interactive 3D scene with multiple interactive elements using Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will showcase your advanced skills by designing a complex interactive 3D scene using Three.js. Your goal is to create an intricate 3D environment with various interactive components that engage the user. You will implement a combination of mouse-based interactions, keyboard controls, and drag-and-drop features to create an immersive and interactive experience.

Requirements:

Setting Up the Scene:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the Three.js scene.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
Complex 3D Environment:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a scene, camera, and renderer.
Design a complex 3D environment with multiple interactive elements. This could include a detailed landscape, buildings, objects, or any creative concept of your choice.
Mouse-Based Interactions:

Implement mouse-based interactions for certain objects or elements within your scene. For example, users can click on objects to trigger animations, change object properties, or reveal hidden content.
Keyboard Controls:

Enable keyboard controls for navigation or interaction within the scene. Users should be able to move, rotate, or perform actions using specific keys or key combinations.
Drag-and-Drop Features:

Incorporate drag-and-drop functionality for certain objects or components. Users should be able to click and drag objects, rearrange elements, or interact with draggable UI elements.
Immersive Experience:

Create an immersive and interactive experience that showcases your skills and creativity. Consider storytelling, thematic elements, or gamification to engage users and make the scene memorable.
Visual Feedback:

Provide clear and engaging visual feedback during interactions. Ensure that users can easily understand the consequences of their actions.
Testing:

Test your complex interactive 3D scene on different browsers and devices to ensure it functions correctly and provides an immersive and enjoyable user experience.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the complexity of your interactive scene, and the mouse-based interactions, keyboard controls, and drag-and-drop features you implemented.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment5_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.
