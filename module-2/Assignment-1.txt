Basic Three.js Scene

Objective: Create a basic Three.js scene with 3D objects.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will start your journey into Three.js by creating a basic 3D scene that contains at least two distinct 3D objects. You will set up an HTML page that includes the necessary Three.js library, create the scene, and experiment with different object geometries and colors.

Requirements:

Setup:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the 3D scene.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
Create a 3D Scene:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a scene, camera, and renderer.
Create a scene, a camera, and a renderer.
Choose at least two different 3D objects (e.g., cube, sphere) to create and add to the scene.
Object Geometries:

Experiment with different object geometries available in Three.js. You can use predefined geometries like BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry, or create custom geometries.
Customize the size, position, and rotation of each object.
Colors:

Apply different colors to the 3D objects. You can use predefined materials like MeshBasicMaterial, MeshLambertMaterial, or create custom materials with varying colors.
Rendering:

Set up the rendering loop to continuously render the scene on the canvas.
Ensure that the objects and their colors are visible in the rendered output.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the 3D objects you chose, the geometries you experimented with, and the colors you applied.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment1_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Scene Creation: Did you successfully create a basic 3D scene with at least two distinct 3D objects?

Object Geometries: Did you experiment with different object geometries and customize their size, position, and rotation?

Colors: Did you apply different colors to the 3D objects and experiment with different materials?

Rendering: Is the scene correctly rendered on the canvas, and are the objects and their colors visible in the output?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to use different object geometries and colors to enhance the scene?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
