Create a 3D Cube

Objective: Create a 3D cube using Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will begin your journey with Three.js by creating a simple 3D cube object. You will set up a basic HTML page with a Three.js environment and experiment with different cube dimensions and colors.

Requirements:

Setup:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the 3D cube.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
3D Cube Assignment:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a scene, camera, and renderer.
Create a scene, a camera, and a renderer.
Create a 3D cube object within the scene. You can use the BoxGeometry for the cube's geometry.
Cube Dimensions:

Experiment with different cube dimensions (e.g., width, height, depth) to change the size and proportions of the cube. Observe how these changes affect the cube's appearance.
Cube Colors:

Apply different colors to the cube using materials. You can use predefined materials like MeshBasicMaterial, MeshLambertMaterial, or create custom materials with varying colors.
Rendering:

Set up the rendering loop to continuously render the scene on the canvas.
Ensure that the cube is correctly displayed and responds to user input.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the cube dimensions you experimented with, the colors you applied, and any challenges you faced.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment1_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

3D Cube Creation: Did you successfully create a 3D cube using Three.js?

Cube Dimensions: Did you experiment with different cube dimensions to understand how they affect the cube's size and proportions?

Cube Colors: Did you apply different colors to the cube, and did you experiment with different materials?

Rendering: Is the cube correctly rendered on the canvas, and does it respond to user input?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to change the cube's appearance using dimensions and colors?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
