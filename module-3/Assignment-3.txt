Plane with Texture Mapping

Objective: Apply a texture map to a 3D plane in Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will learn how to create a 3D plane and apply a texture map to it in Three.js. You will also experiment with adjusting the plane's position and rotation to create a visually interesting landscape.

Requirements:

Building on Previous Work:

Start with the existing Three.js environment and scene you have created in the previous assignments (Assignment 1 and Assignment 2).
Add a 3D Plane:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a plane geometry and a material.
Create a 3D plane using the PlaneGeometry class and add it to your scene.
Texture Acquisition:

Find or create a texture image (e.g., grass, water, or any landscape texture) that you think would suit the plane as a texture map. You can use resources like texture websites, image editing software, or create your own custom texture.
Texture Mapping:

Apply the texture to the 3D plane using UV mapping techniques. Ensure that the texture is correctly mapped to the plane's geometry.
Plane Position and Rotation:

Experiment with different positions and rotations for the plane within your scene. Change its coordinates and angles to create a visually interesting landscape.
Rendering:

Set up the rendering loop to continuously render the scene with the plane and texture map you've configured.
Observe how changes to the plane's position and rotation affect the appearance of the landscape.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the texture image you applied, and the plane's position and rotation settings.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment3_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Plane Creation: Did you successfully create a 3D plane using Three.js?

Texture Mapping: Did you apply a texture map to the plane using UV mapping techniques?

Plane Position and Rotation: Did you experiment with different positions and rotations for the plane to create an interesting landscape?

Rendering: Is the plane with the texture map correctly rendered, and do changes in position and rotation affect the landscape's appearance?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to use textures and plane positioning/rotation to create an engaging landscape?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
