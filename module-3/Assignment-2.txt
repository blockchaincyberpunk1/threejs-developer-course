Sphere with Material

Objective: Understand how to create a 3D sphere with a specified material in Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will expand your knowledge of Three.js by adding a 3D sphere to your existing scene and applying a specific material to it. You will configure various material properties such as color, reflectivity, and shininess to understand their effects on the appearance of the sphere.

Requirements:

Building on Previous Work:

Start with the existing Three.js environment and scene you have created in the previous assignment (Assignment 1).
Add a 3D Sphere:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a sphere geometry and a material.
Create a 3D sphere using the SphereGeometry class and add it to your scene.
Apply Material:

Apply a specific material to the sphere. You can choose from materials like MeshBasicMaterial, MeshLambertMaterial, or MeshPhongMaterial.
Configure material properties such as:
Color: Change the color of the sphere to your preferred choice.
Reflectivity: Adjust the material's reflectivity to control how much it reflects light.
Shininess: Modify the shininess property of the material to control the intensity of highlights.
Sphere Position:

Experiment with different positions for the sphere within your scene. Change its coordinates to observe how the sphere's location affects the rendering.
Rendering:

Set up the rendering loop to continuously render the scene with the sphere and material you've configured.
Observe how changes to material properties impact the appearance of the sphere.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the specific material you applied, and the material properties you configured.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment2_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Sphere Creation: Did you successfully create a 3D sphere using Three.js?

Material Application: Did you apply a specific material to the sphere and configure material properties such as color, reflectivity, and shininess?

Sphere Position: Did you experiment with different positions for the sphere within the scene?

Rendering: Is the sphere correctly rendered with the applied material, and do material properties affect its appearance?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to change the sphere's appearance using different materials and material properties?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
