3D Scene Setup

Objective: Build a 3D scene with multiple objects using Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will expand your skills in Three.js by creating a 3D scene that includes multiple objects. Your task is to position these objects within the scene to create an aesthetically pleasing composition. Additionally, you should experiment with lighting and materials to enhance the visual appeal of the scene.

Requirements:

Setup:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the 3D scene.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
Create a 3D Scene:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a scene, camera, and renderer.
Create a scene, a camera, and a renderer.
Choose at least three different 3D objects (e.g., cube, sphere, torus) to create and add to the scene.
Position Objects:

Position the objects within the scene to create an aesthetically pleasing composition. Experiment with different positions and orientations to achieve an interesting arrangement.
Lighting:

Add at least two different light sources to your scene (e.g., directional light, point light, ambient light).
Experiment with the position, color, and intensity of the lights to create the desired lighting effects.
Materials:

Apply different materials to the objects in your scene. You can use predefined materials like Lambert, Phong, or create custom materials.
Experiment with material properties such as color, shininess, and transparency to enhance the visual appeal of your objects.
Rendering:

Set up the rendering loop to continuously render the scene on the canvas.
Ensure that the objects, lighting, and materials are visible in the rendered output.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the objects you chose, the composition you created, and the lighting and materials you applied.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment2_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Scene Composition: Did you position the objects within the scene to create an aesthetically pleasing composition?

Lighting: Did you add and configure different light sources in the scene to create desired lighting effects?

Materials: Did you apply and experiment with different materials on the objects to enhance visual appeal?

Rendering: Is the scene correctly rendered on the canvas, and are the objects, lighting, and materials visible in the output?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to arrange objects, use lighting, and apply materials to enhance the scene's visual appeal?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
