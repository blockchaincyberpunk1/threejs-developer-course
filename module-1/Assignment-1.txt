Simple 3D Object

Objective: Create a simple 3D object using Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will learn how to create a basic 3D object using Three.js, apply fundamental transformations to it, and render it on an HTML canvas element.

Requirements:

Setup:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the 3D object.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
Create a 3D Object:

In your script.js file, import the necessary Three.js modules to create a scene, camera, and renderer.
Create a scene, a camera, and a renderer.
Choose one of the following 3D objects to create (cube, sphere, or cone) and add it to the scene.
Apply Basic Transformations:

Apply at least three different transformations to your 3D object. Transformations can include rotation, scaling, and translation.
Use different transformation techniques available in Three.js (e.g., rotateX, rotateY, scale, position) to modify the object's appearance and position.
Experiment with different values and sequences of transformations to achieve interesting results.
Rendering:

Set up the rendering loop to continuously render the scene on the canvas.
Ensure that the object and its transformations are visible in the rendered output.
Documentation:

Create a brief README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the 3D object you chose, and the transformations you applied.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment1_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Object Creation: Did you successfully create a 3D object (cube, sphere, or cone) using Three.js?

Transformations: Did you apply at least three different basic transformations to the object? Did you experiment with different transformation values and sequences?

Rendering: Is the object correctly rendered on the canvas, and are the transformations visible in the output?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to use transformations to modify the object's appearance and position?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
