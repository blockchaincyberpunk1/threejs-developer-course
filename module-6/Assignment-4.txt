Advanced Animation Techniques

Objective: Explore advanced animation techniques to bring scenes to life using Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will challenge students to delve into advanced animation techniques using Three.js to create smooth and convincing animations. The objective is to choose a specific animation challenge, such as character rigging and animation, morph targets, or skeletal animation, and implement advanced techniques to bring objects or characters within the scene to life.

Requirements:

Setting Up the Scene:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the Three.js scene.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
Choose an Animation Challenge:

Challenge students to choose a specific animation challenge. They can select one of the following (or a similar advanced animation technique):
Character rigging and animation
Morph targets (also known as shape keys)
Skeletal animation (with bones and skinning)
Implement Advanced Animation Techniques:

Instruct students to implement the chosen animation challenge within their Three.js scene.
For character rigging and animation, students should create a character model with a skeleton and animate it realistically.
For morph targets, students should create and animate objects with morph targets to achieve complex shape transformations.
For skeletal animation, students should rig and animate characters or creatures with bone structures and skinning.
Smooth and Convincing Animations:

Encourage students to focus on creating animations that are smooth, convincing, and enhance the overall realism or creativity of the scene.
Pay attention to details like joint movements, facial expressions (if applicable), and timing.
User Interaction (Optional):

If desired, students can implement user interaction features that allow users to trigger or control the animations.
Testing:

Students should test their advanced animations on different browsers and devices to ensure they are smooth and convincing.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing the chosen animation challenge, the techniques used, and how the animations were implemented.
Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
Provide clear instructions on how to run the code.
Submission:

Compress all project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment4_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Choice of Animation Challenge: Did you choose a specific animation challenge (e.g., character rigging, morph targets, skeletal animation) and clearly describe it in your documentation?

Implementation of Advanced Techniques: Did you successfully implement advanced animation techniques related to the chosen challenge?

Smooth and Convincing Animations: Did you create animations that are smooth, convincing, and enhance the realism or creativity of the scene?

User Interaction (Optional): If included, does the user interaction enhance the assignment and make it more engaging?

Testing: Are the advanced animations smooth and functional on different browsers and devices?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to apply advanced animation techniques to bring scenes to life?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
