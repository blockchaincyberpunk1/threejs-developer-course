Realistic Materials and Textures

Objective: Enhance the realism of 3D objects by applying advanced materials and textures in Three.js.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will focus on improving the realism of 3D objects by applying advanced materials and textures using Three.js. Your objective is to select a complex 3D object, such as a car or character model, and transform it into a lifelike and visually compelling asset. To achieve this, you will apply realistic materials and textures while considering factors like reflections, roughness, and bump mapping.

Requirements:

Setting Up the Scene:

Create a new HTML file named index.html.
Set up the basic structure of an HTML page, including a <canvas> element inside the <body> for rendering the Three.js scene.
Import the Three.js library using a <script> tag in your HTML file. You can use the latest version available at https://threejs.org/.
Create a JavaScript file named script.js and link it to your HTML file using a <script> tag.
Complex 3D Object Selection:

Choose a complex 3D object as your canvas. This could be a car model, a character model, or any other detailed object.
Realistic Materials and Textures:

Import or create realistic materials and textures for the selected 3D object. Pay attention to details like reflections, roughness, and bump mapping.
Experiment with different materials (e.g., Lambert, Phong, PBR) to achieve the desired level of realism.
Apply textures to different parts of the object to add visual complexity and depth.
Lighting Setup:

Create a suitable lighting setup in your scene to illuminate the 3D object and emphasize its materials and textures.
Use a combination of directional lights, point lights, or other light sources to achieve realistic lighting effects.
User Interaction (Optional):

If desired, implement user interaction features that allow users to manipulate the 3D object or change its appearance (e.g., changing colors, materials, or textures).
Testing:

Test your 3D object with realistic materials and textures on different browsers and devices to ensure it appears lifelike and visually compelling.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory describing your assignment, the selected 3D object, the materials and textures applied, and the lighting setup.
Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Provide clear instructions on how to run your code.
Submission:

Compress all your project files (HTML, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment2_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Complex 3D Object Selection: Did you choose a complex 3D object suitable for enhancing realism?

Realistic Materials and Textures: Did you successfully apply realistic materials and textures to the selected 3D object, considering factors like reflections, roughness, and bump mapping?

Lighting Setup: Did you create an appropriate lighting setup to highlight the materials and textures and achieve realistic lighting effects?

User Interaction (Optional): If included, does the user interaction enhance the assignment and make it more engaging?

Testing: Does the 3D object with realistic materials and textures appear lifelike and visually compelling on different browsers and devices?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Creativity: Did you explore creative ways to make the 3D object visually appealing and lifelike?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
