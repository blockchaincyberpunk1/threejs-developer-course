Web Deployment

Objective: Guide students through the process of deploying a Three.js application on the web.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will instruct students to develop a Three.js project and guide them through the process of deploying it to a live web server. The objective is to help students gain practical experience in web deployment, including setting up a web server, optimizing for performance, and making their Three.js application accessible on the internet.

Requirements:

Developing the Three.js Project:

Instruct students to create a Three.js project of their choice. This project should be fully functional and include 3D models, textures, animations, and any other relevant features.
Encourage students to ensure that their project is well-structured and organized.
Setting Up a Web Server:

Task students with setting up a web server to host their Three.js application. They can use Node.js and the Express.js framework or any other server technology of their choice.
Provide resources or documentation on setting up a basic web server using Node.js and Express.js if needed.
Deployment Process:

Guide students through the deployment process, including:
Uploading their project files to the server.
Configuring routing and handling static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, textures, models).
Ensuring that the project works correctly when accessed via a web browser.
Performance Optimization:

Instruct students to consider performance optimizations for web deployment. This may include:
Minifying and compressing JavaScript files to reduce load times.
Using content delivery networks (CDNs) for commonly used libraries or assets.
Implementing caching strategies to improve loading speed for returning visitors.
Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test their deployed application on different browsers and devices to ensure it functions correctly.
Provide guidance on debugging and troubleshooting common deployment issues.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in the project directory that describes the deployment process, performance optimizations applied, and any challenges faced during deployment.
Provide clear instructions on how to access and interact with the deployed Three.js application.
Submission:

Compress all project files (including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment3_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Three.js Project: Did you create a functional and well-structured Three.js project?

Web Server Setup: Did you successfully set up a web server to host your application using Node.js and Express.js or another suitable technology?

Deployment Process: Did you follow the deployment process, including uploading files, configuring routing, and ensuring correct functionality?

Performance Optimization: Did you apply performance optimizations such as minification, CDN usage, and caching to improve loading speed?

Testing and Debugging: Did you thoroughly test your deployed application and address any issues or errors?

Documentation: Is your README.md informative, describing the deployment process, performance optimizations, and any challenges faced?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
