Mobile Optimization

Objective: Prepare students to optimize Three.js applications for mobile devices.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will provide students with a Three.js application that requires optimization for mobile devices. The objective is to teach them mobile-specific optimizations, including touch controls, responsive design, and performance tweaks, to ensure their Three.js applications run smoothly on a variety of mobile devices. Students should test their optimized application on different mobile devices and assess its performance.

Requirements:

Providing the Initial Three.js Application:

Prepare a Three.js application that showcases performance issues or usability challenges when accessed on mobile devices. The application should be functional but not fully optimized for mobile.
Identify Mobile Optimization Needs:

Task students with running the provided application on mobile devices and identifying optimization needs. They should look for performance bottlenecks, usability issues, and other mobile-specific challenges.
Mobile Optimization Techniques:

Instruct students to implement mobile-specific optimization techniques:
Touch Controls: Teach students to add touch-based controls (e.g., touch gestures) for interacting with the 3D scene on mobile devices.
Responsive Design: Guide students in making the application responsive by adapting its layout and content to different screen sizes and orientations.
Performance Tweaks: Encourage students to apply performance tweaks such as reducing the number of polygons in models or using lower-resolution textures for improved performance on lower-end mobile devices.
Testing on Mobile Devices:

Students should test their optimized application on a variety of mobile devices with different screen sizes, resolutions, and performance capabilities.
They should measure and assess the application's performance, responsiveness, and usability on each tested device.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in your project directory that describes the mobile optimization techniques applied, the performance improvements achieved, and any challenges faced during optimization.
Provide clear instructions on how to access and test the optimized application on mobile devices.
Submission:

Compress all project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment4_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Identified Optimization Needs: Did you correctly identify optimization needs for the provided Three.js application when accessed on mobile devices?

Mobile Optimization Techniques: Did you effectively implement mobile-specific optimization techniques, including touch controls, responsive design, and performance tweaks?

Testing on Mobile Devices: Did you thoroughly test your optimized application on various mobile devices and assess its performance, responsiveness, and usability?

Documentation: Is your README.md informative, describing the mobile optimization techniques used, the performance improvements achieved, and any challenges faced?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
