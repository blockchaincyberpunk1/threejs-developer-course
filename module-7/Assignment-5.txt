Cross-Browser Compatibility

Objective: Teach students how to ensure cross-browser compatibility for Three.js applications.

Instructions:

In this assignment, you will instruct students to develop a Three.js application that functions smoothly across various web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and others. The objective is to help them understand and address browser-specific issues related to WebGL support, CSS compatibility, and event handling variations. Students should document their browser compatibility testing process and share their findings.

Requirements:

Developing the Three.js Application:

Instruct students to create a Three.js application with complex 3D scenes, animations, and interactivity. The application should be functional but may initially exhibit browser-specific issues.
Identify Cross-Browser Compatibility Needs:

Task students with running the application on different web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and at least one mobile browser.
Have them identify and document browser-specific issues such as WebGL support variations, CSS compatibility problems, and event handling differences.
Addressing Compatibility Issues:

Guide students in addressing the identified compatibility issues. They should apply techniques such as:
Polyfills: Implement polyfills or feature detection to handle missing or varying features in different browsers.
WebGL Compatibility: Ensure that the application detects and handles WebGL support or fallbacks gracefully.
CSS Compatibility: Adjust CSS styles and layouts to resolve discrepancies between browsers.
Event Handling: Modify event handling code to account for variations in how different browsers handle events.
Browser Compatibility Testing:

Students should conduct thorough browser compatibility testing. They should test the application on different versions of major browsers and document any issues or deviations in behavior.
Encourage them to use browser developer tools and online testing platforms to assist in this process.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file in the project directory that describes the browser compatibility issues encountered, the techniques used to address them, and the results of testing on different browsers.
Sharing Findings:

Instruct students to share their findings and solutions with the class. This could be through a presentation, written report, or a discussion forum, depending on the course setup.
Submission:

Compress all project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, README.md) into a single zip file.

Name the zip file as Assignment5_YourName.zip.

Submit the zip file to the course instructor or upload it to the designated platform.

Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Identification of Compatibility Issues: Did you correctly identify and document browser-specific issues in the Three.js application?

Addressing Compatibility Issues: Did you effectively address compatibility issues using techniques like polyfills, WebGL detection, CSS adjustments, and event handling modifications?

Browser Compatibility Testing: Did you thoroughly test the application on various browsers and versions, documenting any issues or discrepancies?

Documentation: Is your README.md informative, describing the compatibility issues encountered, the techniques used to address them, and the results of browser compatibility testing?

Sharing Findings: Did you actively participate in sharing your findings and solutions with the class as instructed?

Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?

Submission: Did you submit all required project files in the specified format?
